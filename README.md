# Template-Filler
Fills a user given template with rows of a csv file  

# Input
Example csv and template are in resources.  
NOTE: Hardcoded to only work with these for now (could edit the template just not the strings between brackets)  

# Output
Output is directed to the cover_letters directory  

# To Use
npm install  
node index.js  
NOTE: May need to run twice so output directory is created first  

May try to turn this into an interactable page where users can import their own csv and templates and get pdfs from it (not sure how possible that last part is)
